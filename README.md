# TurboRepo Basic Template

I felt that the [basic turbo repo template](https://turbo.build/repo/templates/basic) was a little too detailed, so I created this. Feel free to use it as a starting point!

## What's the difference?

Most of the basic turbo repo template, except:
- `apps/docs`, `apps/web`, and `packages/ui`
